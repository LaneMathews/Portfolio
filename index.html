        My name is Lane Mathews, and I currently reside in Nashville, TN. Before I found my love for programming, my passion was audio engineering. Interestingly enough, programming and audio engineering have a lot in common.

        <p>
        I graduated from Middle Tennessee State University with a B.S. in Audio Production. After college I decided to try programming and absolutely fell in love. Outside of programming, I enjoy taking on new and interesting hobbies.
        </p>
        <p>
        These include:
        </p>
        <!-- Following the About Me introduction is an unordered list of additional hobbies -->
        <ul>
          <li>Sailing</li>
          <li>Blacksmithing</li>
          <li>Bowling</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- After the list is a follow up conclusion paragraph -->
        <p>
        I am excited to further hone my programming skills and grow as a software developer. If you are looking for an adaptable, driven, hardworking developer, please reach out! I am looking forward to working with other developers to build new and interesting software.
